# RewriteRule .* - [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/stylesheets.*
RewriteRule .* - [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/javascripts.*

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/images.*
RewriteRule .* - [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/favicon.*
RewriteRule .* - [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/uploads.*
RewriteRule .* - [L]

# If the request is not a real file on the server...
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

# Then send it to Rails dispatcher
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]
